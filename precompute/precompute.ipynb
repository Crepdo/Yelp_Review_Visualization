       " 'We vacationed in NOLA for a week.. Came here for dinner. Had reservations and waited 15 minutes which wasn t horrible given dinner rush hours. After having chargrilled oysters at other nearby restaurants I feel they are all the same as other places here, all good and tasty. But the star were the fried shrimp and fish platter. The shrimp was so good! Lightly breaded, huge and Juicy and lots of flavor. The raw oysters were really fresh and sweet. Our waiter was very attentive and kind. Would definitely come back for the fried shrimp!',\n",
       " 'Daaaaang, my mom hyped this place up for a reason! She has been to NOLA many times, and this was my 1st visit. She made sure I tried the best oysters in the city, and I was honestly not feeling it. I m not big into seafood, BUT.... these blew me away! The charbroil on them is freakin  delicious with the butter and bread to clean it all up with. Our friends got the crawfish mac n cheese and let me try some, which was also out of this world! Can t wait to go back here again someday! If you haven t tried charbroiled oysters, just do it! You won t be disappointed.  Also, their bread pudding is to die for. Super moist like how it should be and not all dried out.',\n",
       " 'Quick seating, great service and the chargrilled oysters are fantastic. As a main entree I had the seafood pasta which was good. Plenty of seafood in it. My daughter had the shrimp and grits which she wasn t crazy about but it was decent, my husband had the catfish platter which was really good. Overall would return, especially for those oysters. Oh and you ve gotta make sure you have your vaccine card in hand to be seated.',\n",
       " 'Sorry. The raw oyster are excellent. The charbroiled oysters are over breaded. The main dishes are disguised with too much hot sauce. The drinks are weak. Our waiter was excellent but he could not make up for the misses in the menus. I would not go here again.',\n",
       " 'I was told about Drago s from a friend who recently visited New Orleans. It is located in the Hilton hotel. We went on a Saturday night and was a little worried because they don t take reservations. However, we didn t have a wait time and were seated right away.   I ordered the gumbo, charbroiled oysters, and baked market fish. The highlight would have to be the oysters. They were pretty cheap and absolutely delicious. They were so flavorful and you just have to try them. The gumbo was also pretty good and tasted much better than the gumbo I ordered on bourbon street. The fish was good but not worth the price. Stop by and try the oysters.   We also ordered drinks but they were nothing spectacular.',\n",
       " 'We had reservations via Open Table and it took a little bit to get seated but it wasn t too long of a wait. This place was delicious!!! The fried shrimp were huge and juicy, and most importantly the breading was so light yet the shrimp were crispy. Some places the breading is super thick and takes away from the taste. My first time trying grilled oysters and I loved them!! My friends had the raw oysters and enjoyed those as well. Our server was great - very pleasant with conversation and his service was excellent. And he was properly masked!  Only improvement would to have a bigger table to fit all of our food. =  We will definitely return here next time we re in Nola!',\n",
       " 'We came here for my moms 70th bday. First our waitress Brittney was great!! We orders the alligator bites for appetizer since neither had them, to chicken to try the charbroiled oysters which by the way we tried elsewhere . It wasn t even suggested to try even thought that is one of y all popular menu item. Alligator bites were great as long as they were hot. We ordered the fried catfish and shrimp combo with fries an onion rings and the sirloin medium  with lobster and mashed potatoes and side Cesar salad. The fried platter was ok, fries seemed dbl fried, and the onions rings 2  were to hard. The sirloin was cooked well done and the lobster was to tough to eat. We asked for that plate to be replace with the fried platter, which actually came out piping hot, better than mine. Dessert was brownie with ice cream and a LOAD of whipped cream, which was almost the best thing about this birthday dinner besides the cesar salad. For the price it def could of been better. May come back and try the oysters only.',\n",
       " 'I was hesitant because I am not one for oysters  and I work at an oyster bar back home  but holy crap, so yummy!!! We were all very impressed with our food. The only complaint is we had a girl in our party who doesn t eat seafood and online showed a much larger menu and we were told we weren t allowed to order certain things, so she couldn t even get chicken tenders. So make sure everyone loves seafood or doesn t have an allergy!',\n",
       " 'Upon booking our stay at the Hilton Riverside my fiancé and I learned this restaurant was on property. Upon looking at some of the reviews we decided against planning to come here for a meal. Wellll the reviews are wrong. On this rainy Saturday afternoon, our last full day in Nola, we decided not to leave the hotel for lunch and instead dine at Drago s. This was the best decision!! The service here was incredible. Our server Ashanti was such a sweetheart making sure our drinks were never empty, checking on us about our food and just being a little sunshine on this cloudy day!   To start we had the chargrilled oysters, cuz after all its what they re famous for! They were outrageous. The flavors on them and the size of them makes them a definite must have when coming here. For our meals I had the seafood gumbo bowl. The flavors in this dish are just perfect!! Definitely recommend dipping some bread in there!!! My fiancé had the seafood pasta which was sooo deliciously creamy!  Overall I would definitely check this place out if you re in Nola. They are a great place with great staff and great food!!!']"
